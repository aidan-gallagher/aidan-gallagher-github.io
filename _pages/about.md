I love learning new things and tackling challenging problems.

I have worked on multiple large software projects where I've gained experience in different technologies, software architectures, and methodologies.

I am a proponent of agile development. I believe small development teams should be able to work autonomously without unnecessary red tape.

I have lots opinions on software and the software development process, however, I love to be challenged in order to see a different viewpoint and change my mind.
