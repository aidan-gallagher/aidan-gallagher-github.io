I'm a software engineer with a passion for learning new things and tackling exciting problems. I have over 6 years of experience writing software for complex mission-critical systems. 

In my current role, I develop software for a Linux-based network operating system with a focus on the Quality of Service (QoS) feature. The main programming languages I use are C/C++ and Python.

I have many opinions on software design and software development processes; however, I love to be challenged in order to see a different viewpoint and change my mind.
