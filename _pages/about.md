I love learning new things and I'm hoping I can contribute back to the industry by sharing some of my knowledge through the blog posts on this website.

I have worked on multiple (>5) large software projects where I've gained experience in different technologies, software architectures, and methodologies.

I am a proponent of agile development. I believe small development teams should be able to work autonomously without unnecessary red tape. If I have to choose an environment to work in, on a scale from 'strict process' to 'chaos', I would rather the environment leans towards chaos.

I have lots opinions on software and the software development process, however, I love to be challenged in order to see a different viewpoint and change my mind.
