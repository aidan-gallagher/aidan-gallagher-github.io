This is a small subset of the resources I have learned from that I think are worth sharing.

## Agile Principles

## Git

[Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## C++

[C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines): Guidelines for writing modern C++. It is not important to memorize the recommendations because most of them can be enforced using a static analysis tool. It is good to understand the rational behind the guidelines and this is what this document does well.
