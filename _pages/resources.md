This is a small subset of the resources I have learned from that I think are worth sharing.

## Software Architecture

- [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/architecture/)

### Domain Driven Design

- [DDD: The Good Parts - Jimmy Bogard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6CeaA-Phqo) (Youtube video)
- [Domain analysis - Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/domain-analysis)

## Agile Principles

- [Continuous Delivery - Dave Farley](https://www.youtube.com/c/ContinuousDelivery/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) (Youtube channel)

## Git

- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (book)

## C++

- [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines): Guidelines for writing modern C++. It is not important to memorize the recommendations because most of them can be enforced using a static analysis tool. It is good to understand the rational behind the guidelines and this is what this document does well.
- [C++ FAQ](https://isocpp.org/faq): Helps to explain the language design
- [CppCon](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) (Youtube Channel)
- [CppCast](https://open.spotify.com/show/3NPVzS05lvJLv3ovgF3OAP) (podcast): Hit or miss depending on the guest. Good for keeping up to date with what is happening in the C++ ecosystem and hearing real world stories.

### CMake

- [Effective CMake - Daniel Pfeifer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXLMQ6WgIk) (Youtube video)
- [Professional CMake - Craig Scott](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake) (book)

## Documentation

- [Technical Writing - Google](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview) (online course) : A short and well structured course that I highly recommend.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

- [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) (Youtube channel)
- [Introduction to Algorithms - MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) (Youtube playlist)
